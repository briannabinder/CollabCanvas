# CollabCanvas

How to run CollabCanvas: (only works on mac)
1. git clone this repo
2. change permissions by entering "chmod 755 collabcanvas.exe" in your terminal
3. run the code by entering "./collabcanvas.exe" in your terminal
4. If your code does not run it is due to mac's security. Go to System Preferences -> Security & Privacy. Then allow the app to run. (we promise there is nothing bad in the executable file)
